Paper Planes

This is a one-page web design template for a paper supplier. 

It was created using the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript 

It is comprised of the following sections:

* Header -> where the Logo and menu (initially) are located
* Hero/Jumbotron -> where the pitch/catch is located
* About -> Short info about the company and its direction
* Client -> Info about the target clients
* Products -> Some of the products showcased and a button link towards the would-be product page
* Events -> Upcoming company events open to the public
* Footer -> Some site additional site navigation, social media links, copyright

The Menu button remains fixed throughout the site and opens up to the main navigation of the site (important pages)

Author's notes:

I am still continually updating features on the website and applying what I have picked up in my course, as well as from other resources. 

For one, the JavaScript needs more work to add better functionality.

Another thing is the organization of the CSS files. I want to improve on those as well.

If you have any comments and suggestions, feel free to drop me a message. 

Thank you.
