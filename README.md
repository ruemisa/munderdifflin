#### Author's Notes ####

##### Updated #####

I started implementing CSS variables on main.css. It is to organize things a lot better. 

##### Road to Improvement #####

Features are still being improved. Other pages will be added eventually. Separated the CSS into files based on purpose. 

As always, comments and suggestions are welcome.

Thank you very much for visiting.
